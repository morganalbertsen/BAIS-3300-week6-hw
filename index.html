        <h2> About Morgan </h2>
        <img src="./images/IMG_1051.jpg" alt = "Morgan Albertsen" width = "200" />
        <p> I am currently a Senior at the University of Iowa double majoring in Accounting and Business Analytics Information Systems and minoring in Psychology. 
            I grew up in Mundelein, Illinois, a Northwestern Suburb of Chicago. I loved the University of Iowa from the moment I visited. 
            My favorite things I have done so far these 4 years have been going to Hawkeye Football games, visiting Des Moines, and exploring Lake Macbride!
        </p>
            <img src="./images/website.JPG" alt = "Morgan Albertsen and her dog, Richard" width = "200" />
            <p> Following my graduation in May I will be moving out to Denver, Colorado to start my full-time job as a Tax Associate with CliftonLarsonAllen (CLA).
                I think the hardest part about moving will be leaving my dog Richard (other than family and friends of course), who you can see in the picture above.
            </p>
